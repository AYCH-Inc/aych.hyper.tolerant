# Transaction Author Agreement

#### Why It May Be Needed

The ledger is immutable and can be public. 

Due to legal nuances Indy network should support flow to receive explicit confirmation from any transaction author that he accepts the following reality. The ledger is public and immutable and by writing data to the ledger the user will not be able to exercise the right to be forgotten, so no personal data should be published to the ledger. For some instances this flow may be must have, but not required for other instances at all. So this functionality should be implemented on Indy side as optional.
